## TableTennisClassification
 Binary Classification: To predict whether tennis will be played ("Yes") or not played ("No") based on various weather-related features.

# Features:

Outlook: Categorical variable representing the weather outlook. It has three possible values: 'Sunny', 'Overcast', and 'Rainy', which are mapped to numeric values (1, 2, and 3).

Temperature: Categorical variable representing the temperature. It has three possible values: 'Hot', 'Mild', and 'Cool', which are mapped to numeric values (1, 2, and 3).

Humidity: Binary variable representing humidity. It has two values: 'High' (mapped to 0) and 'Normal' (mapped to 1).

Wind: Binary variable representing wind conditions. It has two values: 'Weak' (mapped to 0) and 'Strong' (mapped to 1).

# Target Label:

Play Tennis: Binary variable representing whether tennis is played. It has two values: 'No' (mapped to 0) and 'Yes' (mapped to 1).
Method:

The classification task is performed using a Decision Tree Classifier with Shannon's entropy as the impurity measure. The decision tree is a machine learning model that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions based on the provided features.
Visualization:

The code generates a visualization of the decision tree using Graphviz and displays it within the Jupyter Notebook. The decision tree provides insights into how the model makes decisions based on the features to classify whether tennis will be played or not.

The classification task aims to predict whether tennis can be played based on the weather conditions. The decision tree model learns from the provided data to make predictions. The visualization of the decision tree can help understand the rules and conditions used by the model for classification.
